The included IPython notebook is the content of a presentation I gave at [PyCarolinas](http://blog.pycarolinas.org/) 2012 on data persistence in Python.

The second half of the notebook requires a locally running [Redis](http://redis.io/) server (which is very easy to set up on a *nix system); it also requires the [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py) Python module.
